# Nodejs Master Class
Nodejs Master Class is an online course focused on teaching plain nodejs by building different projects (REST Api, Web App GUI, CLI App) with No Frameworks, No NPM, No Dependencies.
This repository is an implementation of the course projects.

## Disclaimer
Some of the code is tweaked to my taste (for convenience), not following the same structure.
